This theme is *not* recommended for use. If you're a Builder Tools team (or if
you publish docs to BuilderHub) then you should be using BuilderHubDocTheme,
instead.

However, it's here to exist without dependencies on any other package, and to
provide basic styling using the required btdocs-config parameters:

* source_url
* feedback_url
* feedback_sim_folder
* feedback_sim_assign
* feedback_description
* relative_url
* path_to_root

Don't expect it to be pretty or to meet your needs, but you can use this as a
basis for other themes.
